# Clothing Design and Avatar Creation Application

## Overview

Welcome to the Clothing Design and Avatar Creation Application! This project leverages cutting-edge deep learning techniques to generate unique clothing designs based on user input prompts and create personalized avatars. The application uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for clothing design and advanced image processing for avatar creation.

- Generate unique clothing designs based on user input prompts using GANs.
- Create high-quality, realistic clothing designs.
- Create personalized avatars that resemble the user's personality.
- Dress these avatars in the generated clothing designs.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Primary programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Frameworks for building and training GANs and avatar models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for quick prototyping.
- **NVIDIA GPUs**: For accelerated training of deep learning models.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for model development.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
